Meant to be a knowledge base specifically for my career as physicist. 
Is organized by topics, each folder being a core topic defined by basic areas of physics: [[Electrodynamics]], [[Thermodynamics]], [[Statistical Physics]] (added as created to list) as well as a directory for mathematics only. The library is organized in the same fashion.

Each topic directory is going to contain a main file with the same name. In it an introduction and/or an overview of the topics in other notes is to be presented including wikilinks. Kind of the same as the table of contents presented here.
