> Generate 500 points uniformly at random on the surface of a unit radius ball in 50 dimensions. Then randomly generate five additional points. For each of the five new points, calculate a narrow band of width 2/âˆš50 at the equator, assuming the point was the North Pole. How many of the 500 points are in each band corresponding to one of the five equators? How many of the points 2 are in all five bands? How wide do the bands need to be for all points to be in all five bands?

Let's begin with 3 dimensions.
