# Important theorems

## Linear momentum
$$\frac{d\mathbf p}{dt}=\mathbf F$$
## Angular momentum
## Work and energy
$$dW = dT$$
## Energy conservation
## König’s Theorems
### The angular momentum of the system, relative to O, is equal to the sum of the angular momentum of the centre of mass relative to O and the angular momenta of the components of the system with respect to G.
### The kinetic energy of the system, relative to O, is equal to the sum of the centre of mass kinetic energy with respect to O and the kinetic energy of the components of the system relative to G
